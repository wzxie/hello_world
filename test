Wheat is a globally vital crop, but its limited genetic variation creates a challenge for breeders aiming to maintain or accelerate agricultural improvements over time. Introducing novel genes and alleles from wheat's wild relatives into the wheat breeding pool via introgression lines is an important component of overcoming this low variation but is constrained by poor genomic resolution and limited understanding of the genomic impact of introgression breeding program
